Now that we've fixed the cart issue and can successfully add items, let's try to complete a purchase. When choosing Apple Pay as the payment method, customers encounter an error that prevents them from completing their transaction.

## Examining the Error in Sentry

Let's check Sentry to see what's happening with this error:

<ScaledImage 
  src="/assets/img/CheckoutErrorSentry.png" 
  alt="Checkout Issue" 
  size={80}
  caption="Error details in Sentry for the Apple Pay failure" 
/>

The error message indicates that the Apple Pay transaction is failing because of invalid or incomplete shipping address information. Let's examine the details:

- Error Message: "Apple Pay transaction failed: Shipping address information is invalid or incomplete."
- Stack Trace: Points to a problem in the PaymentService
- User Impact: Every customer attempting to use Apple Pay encounters this error

## Using Tracing to Debug the Checkout Flow

Instead of just relying on error messages, let's use Sentry's tracing capabilities to visualize the entire checkout process and understand exactly where and why it's failing.

Let's first look at the payment flow. There are two key files to examine:

1. `app/checkout.tsx` - Contains the checkout UI and payment process
2. `services/PaymentService.ts` - Contains the payment processing logic

### Adding Tracing to the Checkout Process

Let's add tracing to our payment service to get better visibility into what's happening:

```javascript
// In services/PaymentService.ts
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

// Update the processPayment method to include tracing
static async processPayment(
  paymentMethodId: string,
  addressId: string | null,
  items: CartItem[],
  total: number
): Promise<PaymentResult> {
  return Sentry.startSpan(
    { name: "processPayment" }, 
    async (span) => {
      // Set payment information as span attributes
      span.setAttributes({
        paymentMethodId,
        hasAddressId: addressId !== null,
        itemCount: items.length,
        total
      });
      
      // Simulate network delay
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
      
      // Find selected payment method
      const paymentMethod = this.getPaymentMethodById(paymentMethodId);
      
      if (!paymentMethod) {
        span.setAttributes({
          paymentError: 'Payment method not found',
          paymentStatus: 'error'
        });
        
        return {
          success: false,
          error: 'Payment method not found'
        };
      }
      
      // Add payment method details to span
      span.setAttributes({
        paymentMethodType: paymentMethod.type,
        paymentMethodName: paymentMethod.name
      });
      
      // Process payment based on type
      let result;
      switch (paymentMethod.type) {
        case 'card':
          result = await Sentry.startSpan(
            { name: "processCardPayment" },
            async () => this.processCardPayment(paymentMethod, total)
          );
          break;
        case 'paypal':
          result = await Sentry.startSpan(
            { name: "processPayPalPayment" },
            async () => this.processPayPalPayment(total)
          );
          break;
        case 'applepay':
          result = await Sentry.startSpan(
            { name: "processApplePayPayment" },
            async (childSpan) => {
              childSpan.setAttributes({
                addressId: addressId || 'null',
                total
              });
              return this.processApplePayPayment(addressId, total);
            }
          );
          break;
        default:
          span.setAttributes({
            paymentError: 'Unsupported payment method',
            paymentStatus: 'error'
          });
          
          result = {
            success: false,
            error: 'Unsupported payment method'
          };
      }
      
      // Add result to span
      span.setAttributes({
        paymentSuccess: result.success,
        paymentError: result.error || 'none',
        transactionId: result.transactionId || 'none'
      });
      
      return result;
    }
  );
}
```

Now, let's update the Apple Pay processing method to use tracing:

```javascript
/**
 * Process an Apple Pay payment with tracing
 */
private static processApplePayPayment(
  addressId: string | null,
  total: number,
  parentSpan: Sentry.Span
): PaymentResult {
  // Apple Pay requires a shipping address to process the payment
  
  if (addressId === null) {
    parentSpan.setAttributes({
      paymentError: 'Shipping address is required for Apple Pay',
      paymentStatus: 'error'
    });
    
    const error = new Error('Shipping address is required for Apple Pay');
    console.error(error);
    throw error;
  }
  
  // Trace the address lookup
  return Sentry.startSpan(
    { name: "fetchAddressForApplePay" },
    (span) => {
      span.setAttributes({
        addressId,
        action: 'address_lookup'
      });
      
      // BROKEN: Even if addressId is provided, we're not fetching or using the actual address details
      // The Apple Pay API requires the complete address object, not just the ID
      
      try {
        // Try to get the address but don't use it
        const address = this.getAddressById(addressId);
        
        // Record if we found the address
        span.setAttributes({
          addressFound: address !== undefined,
          addressCity: address?.city || 'unknown',
          addressComplete: address !== undefined
        });
        
        // Instead, we'll just throw an error that looks like it came from Apple Pay
        const addressError = new Error('Apple Pay transaction failed: Shipping address information is invalid or incomplete.');
        console.error(addressError);
        
        span.setAttributes({
          paymentError: 'Address information not used in payment processing',
          paymentStatus: 'error'
        });
        
        throw addressError;
      } catch (error: any) {
        span.setAttributes({
          paymentError: error.message,
          paymentStatus: 'error'
        });
        
        throw error;
      }
    }
  );
  
  // WORKING VERSION (uncomment to fix):
  // return Sentry.startSpan(
  //   { name: "fetchAddressForApplePay" },
  //   (span) => {
  //     span.setAttributes({
  //       addressId,
  //       action: 'address_lookup'
  //     });
  //     
  //     // Fetch the full address
  //     const address = this.getAddressById(addressId);
  //     
  //     // Make sure the address exists
  //     if (!address) {
  //       span.setStatus({
  //         code: Sentry.SpanStatusType.ERROR,
  //         message: 'Invalid shipping address'
  //       });
  //       
  //       return {
  //         success: false,
  //         error: 'Invalid shipping address'
  //       };
  //     }
  //     
  //     // Record that we found and are using the address
  //     span.setAttributes({
  //       addressFound: true,
  //       addressCity: address.city,
  //       addressComplete: true,
  //       addressUsed: true
  //     });
  //     
  //     // Success!
  //     return {
  //       success: true,
  //       transactionId: `applepay-${Date.now()}`
  //     };
  //   }
  // );
}
```

## Analyzing the Trace in Sentry

After adding tracing and reproducing the error, we can examine the trace in Sentry. 

The error is showing up, and we can search for the Trace by navigating to the "Tracing" tab under "Explore" on the left, and using the Trace Explorer to find the trace. We can use the text field to search for the name or span operation.

<ScaledImage 
  src="/assets/img/traceExplorerSearch.png" 
  alt="traceExplorerSearch" 
  size={90}
  caption="Trace Explorer Search" 
/>

Once we find it, we can click into the trace and explore its details.

  src="/assets/img/paymentTraceDetails.png" 
  alt="Payment Trace" 
  size={90}
  caption="Trace visualization showing the flow of the payment process" 
/>

### How to Analyze the Payment Trace

Let's examine the trace to understand what's happening:

1. **Identify the main transaction**: The `processPayment` span shows the entire payment flow.

2. **Examine the span hierarchy**: Note how the flow branches from `processPayment` to `processApplePayPayment` and then to `fetchAddressForApplePay`.

3. **Check span attributes**: Click on each span to view its attributes:
   - In the `processPayment` span, we can see the payment method is "applepay" and there's an addressId

<ScaledImage 
  src="/assets/img/processPaymentHasAddress.png" 
  alt="processPayment" 
  size={80}
  caption="processPayment span attributes" 
/>

   - In the `fetchAddressForApplePay` span, we can see if the address was found.

<ScaledImage 
  src="/assets/img/fetchAddressFailed.png" 
  alt="fetchAddressFailed" 
  size={80}
  caption="fetchAddressFailed span attributes" 
/>

4. **Look for error attributes**: The `fetchAddressForApplePay` span has attributes indicating an error with the message "Address information not used in payment processing"

<ScaledImage 
  src="/assets/img/addressErrored.png" 
  alt="addressErrored" 
  size={40}
  caption="addressErrored span attributes" 
/>

5. **Follow the error flow**: Notice how errors are captured as attributes in each span, showing how the error propagates through the system

### What the Trace Reveals

The trace clearly shows:

1. The address ID is provided to the payment method
2. The address is successfully found in our database (addressFound: true)
3. But the Apple Pay processor isn't actually using the address information
4. This results in the "invalid or incomplete" shipping address error

This visualization helps us understand that the issue isn't with missing data, but with how the data is (or isn't) being used in the processing flow.

## Fixing the Issue

Based on our trace analysis, we need to modify the `processApplePayPayment` method to actually use the address that it successfully looks up:

```javascript
/**
 * Process an Apple Pay payment with tracing
 */
private static processApplePayPayment(
  addressId: string | null,
  total: number,
  parentSpan: Sentry.Span
): PaymentResult {
  // Apple Pay requires a shipping address to process the payment
  
  if (addressId === null) {
    parentSpan.setAttributes({
      paymentError: 'Shipping address is required for Apple Pay',
      paymentStatus: 'error'
    });
    
    return {
      success: false,
      error: 'Shipping address is required for Apple Pay'
    };
  }
  
  return Sentry.startSpan(
    { name: "fetchAddressForApplePay" },
    (span) => {
      span.setAttributes({
        addressId,
        action: 'address_lookup'
      });
      
      // Fetch the full address
      const address = this.getAddressById(addressId);
      
      // Make sure the address exists
      if (!address) {
        span.setAttributes({
          paymentError: 'Invalid shipping address',
          paymentStatus: 'error'
        });
        
        return {
          success: false,
          error: 'Invalid shipping address'
        };
      }
      
      // Record that we found and are using the address
      span.setAttributes({
        addressFound: true,
        addressCity: address.city,
        addressComplete: true,
        addressUsed: true
      });
      
      // In a real app, we would use the address details to create a payload
      // and send it to the Apple Pay API
      
      // Success!
      return {
        success: true,
        transactionId: `applepay-${Date.now()}`
      };
    }
  );
}
```

Let's make this change to fix the issue:

1. Open `services/PaymentService.ts`
2. Find the `processApplePayPayment` method
3. Replace the broken code with the working version that uses the address

After making this change, let's try checking out with Apple Pay again:

<ScaledImage 
  src="/assets/img/paymentSuccess.png" 
  alt="paymentSuccess" 
  size={40}
  caption="Successfully completed payment with Apple Pay" 
/>

## Viewing the Successful Trace

After fixing the issue, let's look at the successful payment trace:

<ScaledImage 
  src="/assets/img/SuccessfulPaymentTrace.png" 
  alt="Successful Payment Trace" 
  size={90}
  caption="Trace visualization showing the successful payment flow" 
/>

Notice how all spans complete successfully, and the attributes show that the address was both found and used in the payment process.

## What We Learned

Using tracing for our payment debugging provided several key insights:

1. **Visualizing the Entire Process**: Tracing showed us the complete payment flow, not just where it failed.

2. **Data Flow Visibility**: We could see that the address was successfully fetched but not used in the payment processing.

3. **Context Through Attributes**: Span attributes provided rich context about what data was available at each step.

4. **Error Propagation**: We could see how errors propagated up through the span hierarchy.

5. **Process Validation**: After fixing the issue, tracing confirmed our entire payment flow was working correctly.

## Best Practices for Payment Processing with Tracing

When implementing payment processing with tracing:

1. **Trace the Entire Flow**: Create a parent span for the whole payment process and child spans for each step.

2. **Add Meaningful Attributes**: Include relevant data as span attributes at each stage.

3. **Set Appropriate Status**: Use status codes to indicate success or failure states.

4. **Verify Data Availability**: Use attributes to confirm required data is available throughout the process.

5. **Compare Before and After**: Compare traces before and after fixes to validate improvements.

Tracing is particularly valuable for payment systems because it visualizes the entire flow of data through complex, multi-step processes, making it easier to spot exactly where things go wrong.

Now that we've fixed the checkout flow, customers can successfully complete their purchases using Apple Pay, improving their shopping experience and increasing conversion rates for the store.
