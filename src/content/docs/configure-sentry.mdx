Let's face itâ€”your code is going to break, even when its mobile. The question is: how fast can you fix it when it does? In this section, we'll add Sentry to our Unborked Mobile application so we can catch those errors in the wild before our users start tweeting about them.

## Setting Up Sentry

<Steps>
  1. **Run the Sentry CLI Wizard**

     Get Sentry integrated with our ErrorFix application quickly:

     ```bash
     npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i reactNative
     ```

     This wizard will:
     - Configure the Sentry SDK in React Native 
     - Enable error monitoring, and mobile replays
     - Create your Sentry project if you don't have one yet

  2. **Complete the initial authentication flow**

     The wizard will prompt you  to get started, and warn you if there are files that have not been committed yet, from here, it will install the React Native SDK, and then ask if you're using Sentry SaaS or self-hosted. 

     We're working out of SaaS, so select that, and once you choose yes for having a Sentry account, it'll prompt you to login. 

     <ScaledImage 
      src="/assets/img/cliFlow.png" 
      alt="Sentry Wizard" 
      size={60}
      caption="Sentry Wizard" 
     />
     
     The wizard will guide you into project configuration.

  3. **Select or Create a Project**

     Choose your Sentry project:

     <ScaledImage 
      src="/assets/img/Unborked-Mobile-Project.png" 
      alt="Unborked Mobile Project" 
      size={60}
      caption="Unborked Mobile Project" 
     />

     - If you don't have one yet, the wizard can create it for you
     - Select "React Native" as the platform

  4. **Choose Features to Enable**

     You'll be asked which features to enable, Mobile Replay and/or User Feedback. For this workshop we'll focus on Mobile Replay only. 

     <ScaledImage 
      src="/assets/img/cliFlowReplay.png" 
      alt="Mobile Replay Features" 
      size={60}
      caption="Mobile Replay Features" 
     />

  5. **Complete the setup**

     The wizard will prompt you to configure your first error, fortunately, our app is already broken so we'll say yes and move along. We're ready to get started.
</Steps>



## What Gets Added to Your Project

<Steps>
  1. **Configuration Files the React Native application**

     The wizard adds specific config directives for different parts of the application:

     - `app/_layout.tsx` - Where the Sentry configurations are added to
     - `app.json` - Sentry Expo plugin configurations added 
     - `metro.config.js` - The Sentry expo configurations added 

     Here's what the `app/_layout.tsx` configuration looks like:

     ```javascript
     import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

      Sentry.init({
         dsn: '<Your Sentry DSN>',

         // Adds more context data to events (IP address, cookies, user, etc.)
         // For more information, visit: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/data-management/data-collected/
         sendDefaultPii: true,

         // Configure Session Replay
         replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
         replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1,
         integrations: [Sentry.mobileReplayIntegration(), Sentry.feedbackIntegration()],

         // uncomment the line below to enable Spotlight (https://spotlightjs.com)
         // spotlight: __DEV__,
      });
     ```

  2. **Update the configuration to enable Tracing**

      We'll need to update the configuration to match the below: 

      ```javascript
         import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

         Sentry.init({
            dsn: '<Your Sentry DSN>',

            sendDefaultPii: true,
            tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

            replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
            replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
            integrations: [Sentry.mobileReplayIntegration(), Sentry.feedbackIntegration()],

         });
         ```
      We're adding in the tracesSampleRate property and setting it to 1.0 to sample 100% of spans coming inbound. Span sampling lets us control how many of the traces that are sent to Sentry are actually kept and used. Setting these high is helpful for debugging, but in production you'll want to set them lower to avoid sending too much data.

  3. **Increase Replay Sample Rate and Unmask Content**

      To simplify debugging and show a bit more content in the workshop, we're going to also bump up the sample rate for all replays, and set the flags that will unmask the content in Replays. In production environments this not recommended as it can expose sensitive data - but in a workshop, YOLO. 

      ```javascript
      import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

      Sentry.init({
         dsn: '<Your Sentry DSN>',

         sendDefaultPii: true,
         tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

         replaysSessionSampleRate: 1,0,
         replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
         integrations: [Sentry.mobileReplayIntegration(
            maskAllText: false,
            blockAllMedia: false,
         ), Sentry.feedbackIntegration()],
      });
      ```
      



  3. **Restart the simulator (sometimes...)**

     Since we've installed singificant packages as part of our setup, we might need to restart the simulator. Cancel it, and run the following command again:

     ```bash
     npx expo run:ios
     ```
</Steps>

## Testing Unborked Mobile

<Steps>
  1. **Test login**

     When the application restarts, you should be able to attempt to login with SSO, which should trigger an error... and now, we're good to go!

      <ScaledImage 
      src="/assets/img/ssoFirstError.png" 
      alt="ssoFirstError" 
      size={40}
      caption="ssoFirstError" 
      />
    
  2. **Verify in Sentry Dashboard**

     Log in to your Sentry account and check the "Issues" section to see the errors you've triggered. You should see detailed information about the error. If you dive into this error you should see:
     
     - Stack traces
     - Request information
     - Mobile replays

      <ScaledImage 
      src="/assets/img/unborkedFirstIssue.png" 
      alt="unborkedFirstIssue" 
      size={90}
      caption="unborkedFirstIssue" 
      />

</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that Sentry is configured in your application, you're ready to start the workshop exercises. These will guide you through common scenarios and show you how to use Sentry to diagnose and fix them.
