## What We've Covered

Throughout this workshop, you've gained hands-on experience with Sentry's error monitoring and debugging capabilities for mobile applications. Let's recap what we've learned:

### 1. Tuning Alerts in Sentry

We started by understanding how to configure Sentry alerts effectively to avoid alert fatigue and ensure you get notified about issues that truly matter. You learned:

- How to set up volume-based alert rules to trigger based on error frequency
- The importance of adjusting alert thresholds to reduce noise
- Different alert types available in Sentry, from issue alerts to performance and anomaly detection

### 2. Debugging SSO with Sentry Issues

In our first debugging exercise, we tackled a broken Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality:

- You explored Sentry's comprehensive issue details, including user impact and device information
- You learned how stack traces help pinpoint exactly where in the code an error occurs
- You experienced how mobile replays provide insight into the user's perspective when errors happen
- You successfully identified and fixed a missing password parameter in the authentication flow

### 3. Troubleshooting Cart Functionality with Tracing

Next, we addressed a cart functionality issue using Sentry's powerful tracing capabilities:

- You implemented tracing to visualize the complete data flow across components
- You learned how to add span attributes to capture critical context at each step
- You analyzed trace data to identify that products were missing required SKU properties
- You fixed the issue by properly preparing products before adding them to the cart

### 4. Debugging Checkout with Tracing

In our final exercise, you tackled a payment processing issue with Apple Pay:

- You implemented comprehensive tracing across the entire payment flow
- You discovered how to examine trace hierarchies and attributes to understand complex processes
- You identified that although address data was being fetched, it wasn't being properly used
- You fixed the Apple Pay payment process by ensuring address data was properly incorporated

## Key Takeaways

Through these practical debugging scenarios, you've mastered several essential Sentry skills:

- **Issue Identification**: Using Sentry to quickly identify and prioritize critical issues
- **Context Gathering**: Leveraging stack traces, device info, and user impact data to understand problems
- **Visual Debugging**: Using mobile replays to see exactly what users experienced
- **Data Flow Visualization**: Implementing tracing to understand complex interactions between components
- **Attribute Tracking**: Adding span attributes to provide critical context at each step
- **Systematic Debugging**: Using a methodical approach to identify, analyze, and fix issues
